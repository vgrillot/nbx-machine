Overview                                                                                                                                                         Page 2


The Nightmare Before Christmas Pinball Adventure is so named because it is ultimately an adventure through many pinball modes, ultimately culminating in several
wizard modes for those who's skills are supreme. The modes which can be played on the table are separated into three groups: Character Modes which are started
in various ways based on which character is represented by the mode, Hinterlands Door Modes which are activated by getting the ball into the Hinterlands, and
Oogie Boogie modes which are started by bashing down the bugs guarding his lair, dropping a gate, and getting the ball inside.


There is some stacking involved, as you can have one Character, one Hinterlands, and one Oogie Boogie mode all running at once, but you can only activate new
modes while a single ball is in play. If a multiball begins, new modes cannot be started until the multiball ends. The most dynamic aspect of the scoring is shot
multiplying. There are ten major shots on the board which can be multiplied through a fairly simple, but tricky process. Multiplying shots not only multiplies the
scores given by those shots, but also any other numerical happenings, such as getting multiple spins per spin of a spinner, or extra toys.


"Toys" are one of the more interesting aspects of the game as they have several effects as you collect them. Typically, you earn toys as awards or from the pop
bumpers. Toys go towards your end of ball bonus, but also come into play in one of the wizard modes and also affects how much time you get to complete modes
in general.


The scoring is laid out so that it's possible to get extremely high scores compared to the average person, but doing so requires making a lot of different things come
together all at once. To compare the scoring to existing games, the best comparisons would be Creature from the Black Lagoon and Fish Tales, which are also built
to give fairly balanced scores unless you're able to chain multiple tricky shots all together exactly when you need them. Here in TNBC, qualifying shot multipliers
and super jackpots on those multiplied shots is how you're able to get excessive scores, but making this work is incredibly difficult, more so than just playing the
game and going for wizard modes.


There are a total of four wizard modes, one for each group of regular modes and a final, ultimate wizard mode which can only be reached if all three of the other
wizard modes have been played. Qualifying the first three wizard modes not only means playing the regular modes, but completing them, thus timing out modes is
not an option if you want to go for wizard modes.

Skill Shots


Skill Shot #1
If you soft-plunge into the Bathtub Hole, you get a 1,000,000 skill shot, multiplied by the current ball number.


Skill Shot #2
If you soft-plunge to the upper-right flipper and make the left toy-orbit shot, you will get a Skill Shot worth a fixed 2,500,000 points. This is the best one to go for on
Ball 1 and 2, however, for Ball 3 (and 4/5 if playing a 5-ball game) you're better off going with Skill Shot #1.


Super Skill Shot
Normally, if you attempt to full-plunge, the popup post will cause the ball to fall into the toy pops. If you hold the left flipper up while plunging, the popup post will go
down (and stay down) the instant the ball leaves the shooter lane, allowing the ball to go all the way around the orbit. Simply make any major shot after this without
qualifying the playfield to score 4,000,000 points and 25 toys. All major shot triangles will flash cyan to indicate that you're ready to go for a Super Skill Shot.


Secret Skill Shot
If you want to get really crazy, soft-plunge the ball and get it down to the main flippers without hitting any switches or slingshots, then shoot the right ramp. This will
always send the ball into the Zero lane and will award a "Secret Skill Shot" worth 1,000,000 points, multiplied by the current ball number, 25 toys, lowers the Oogie
Boogie gate if it's up, increases the bonus multiplier by 1x, and opens the shooter lane diverter on the Soup Shot for 10 seconds as though you had just made the
Soup Shot, making it possible to immediately go for a shot tripler. The game will actually flash the right ramp triangle cyan after about seven seconds if it thinks
you're in the process of doing this, detected by confirming that the ball is not in the shooter lane, that you didn't qualify a Super Skill Shot, that no switches have
been hit, and that one of the flippers has been up for seven seconds straight.

Toys & Pop Bumpers                                                                                                                                                   Page 6


The pop bumpers are only worth 1,200 points per hit. However, each time you hit one you also get a "Toy" which is a cumulative value kept throughout the game
which factors into your end of ball bonus, but is also a factor for jackpots, timed modes, and the "Deliver the Presents" wizard mode.


Jackpots         All "jackpots" are increased by 10,000 points per toy you have. If the shot is worth a lot but is NOT a jackpot, it is unaffected.
Timed Modes      All modes with time limits will get a 1 second increase to its initial time limit per 100 toys you have. Does not affect combos and non-mode timers.
Presents         When in "Deliver the Presents" each present delivered actually drops your toy count by 1. More details can be found in the section for this mode.


Toys are often awarded from other methods as well, plus you can upgrade a single pop bumper by spelling SANTA or by collecting the appropriate Mystery award,
or there's also a mystery award "Pops at Max" which will upgrade all three pop bumpers to triple value. The lights of the pops change from white, to green, to red to
indicate 1x, 2x, and 3x value, which affects both the points awarded and the toys collected.


Also, any time a shot you make which scores toys happens to have a shot multiplier attached, the toys awarded are also affected. Thus if you make a combo which
awards 10 toys on a tripled shot, you get 30 toys!




SANTA Lights


There are five lanes by the flippers: two outlanes and three return lanes. The lights above them spell SANTA. If they're completed, you're given a SANTA award
which consists of several things:


        Awards a base value of 100,000 points, increased by 50,000 for each subsequent completion over the course of the game (capped at 500,000), plus an
         additional 200 multiplied by the end-of-ball bonus multiplier and multiplied again by the number of toys collected. (125 toys at 4x bonus would be 100,000
         additional points.)
        Awards a Toy Pops upgrade.
        Lights the Mystery Shot once per ball. If the mystery shot is already lit, this is NOT wasted and can still be obtained later in the ball.


One trick to this however is that it's possible to alley pass the first 'A' in Santa. To prevent abuse of this, if SANTA is completed twice in a row without hitting any
other switches other than SANTA switches, the SANTA lights will flash red and the display will show "Santa is Exhausted" which is worth a random number of
points from 10 to 19,990.




JACK Targets


When you light all four JACK lights by hitting the standups for them at the sides of the two major ramps, you raise the bonus multiplier by 1x up to a maximum of
12x. Completing the JACK lights with no character mode or multiball running also qualifies the frenzy mode "W hat's This?" by getting the ball into the Hinterlands
(normally, shooting the Hinterlands starts a Door Mode) and also qualifies "Where's Jack?" or "The Scientific Method" (if all other character modes are completed)
by shooting any of the other holes. (Graveyard, Mayor, Soup.) Since both are qualified at the same time, if you qualify a different character mode, all JACK-related
modes are disqualified. If one's already been completed it won't be qualified. If both have been completed neither will.


Completing the JACK lights when the bonus multiplier is already up to a maximum of 12x awards 1,000,000 points.

Shot Multiplier                                                                                                                                                       Page 7


Whenever you make the Soup Shot under the upper flipper, the diverter beside it opens up for 10 seconds. If you manage to quickly get the ball into the Soup Shot
again, the ball will be diverted to the shooter lane and the circle lights on all the major shots will start flashing blue. The next major shot you make will then have a
2x multiplier applied to it for the rest of the ball, indicated by a solid blue circle. This not only affects raw points awarded from making the shot, but affects ALL things
awarded by that shot, including stitches, toys, jackpots, mystery awards, combos, time awards, multiplier advances, etc. The only things you can't double are extra
balls and specials. This is referred to by the display as the Soup Doubler.


However, it's also possible to get a tripler, but this process is trickier. You not only have to get the diverter open, but you have to get the ball into the Zero kickback,
then let the kickback fire the ball all the way to the diverter without hitting more than one unintended switch along the way. This is referred to on the display as the
"Zero Tripler" and the circle lights will flash purple instead of blue, plus the tripled shot will stay solid purple instead of solid blue.


There are some tricks to this. First of all, if you apply a doubler or tripler to a shot which has already been affected, it's wasted. Furthermore, overwriting a doubled
shot with a tripled shot is all well and good, but you can also accidentally overwrite a tripled shot with a doubled shot. There's no time limit on setting your
doubled/tripled shot. Once the ball ends all doublers and triplers are lost.




Soup Hurry-Up


If you get 100 stitches in normal play (outside of all modes and so long as the hurry up is not running) it starts the Soup Hurry-Up where you must get the ball to the
Soup Shot under the upper flipper within 15 seconds. The base value of the hurry up starts at 2,000,000 and after 2 seconds starts dropping by 2.5% of its base
value every quarter-second down to a minimum value of 10% of the base value. Every stitch earned from the spinner while the hurry up is running increases the
base value by 50,000 points for the rest of the game. If the shooter lane diverter is open when you make the Soup Shot you still get the hurry up award.




End of Ball Bonus


At the end of each ball you get bonus points based on the following cumulative values tracked throughout the game:


1 Toy = 250 Bonus
1 Tombstone = 1,000 Bonus
1 Stitch (spinner spins) = 100 Bonus
1 Mode Completed = 2,500 Bonus
Bonus Multiplier Held on Last Ball = 100,000 Bonus


There is also a bonus multiplier which is raised by spelling JACK. It can be raised up to a maximum of 12x and can also be held between balls by making a 4x
combo or from a potential mystery award. Because the bonus does not decrement at any point in the game, if your bonus is held when you lose your last ball you
simply get a special awarded factored into your multiplied bonus, as opposed to getting your bonus twice as would be the case in some games.

Combos                                                                                                                                                            Page 8


Whenever you hit one of the 10 major shots without a multiball running, the other 9 will light up with flashing yellow triangles to indicate a combo potential for the
next 7 seconds of ball time (combo timer stops if no balls are on the playfield). When you hit one of these shots, the light goes out and you'll have one less shot you
can combo off of. Getting a 10x combo is worth huge points as well as a special, but is incredibly challenging to do. Combos are not awarded if a multiball is
running and modes have priority for the colour of the triangle lights. The potential combo awards are as follows:


2x      50,000 Points
3x      75,000 Points + 5 Toys
4x      100,000 Points + 5 Toys + Hold Bonus Multiplier (Only once per ball)
5x      125,000 Points + 10 Toys
6x      150,000 Points + 10 Toys + Light Mystery (Only once per ball)
7x      300,000 Points + 20 Toys
8x      500,000 Points + 30 Toys + Extra Ball (Only once per game)
9x      1,000,000 Points + 50 Toys
10x     5,000,000 Points + 100 Toys + Special (Only once per game)


Three of the major shots may not return the ball imm ediately or may act unusual. The Mayor shot is a scoop, thus the combo timer is halted until the ball is back on
the playfield. The Soup shot is the same way, although the Soup shot can also divert to the shooter lane, in which case the timer is halted until the ball is plunged
back onto the playfield and a switch is hit. The Graveyard shot has the tombstone drop target in front of it, but hitting the tombstone will count towards the combo all
the same, unlike most shots to the Graveyard which must actually make it past the tombstone to count.

"This is Halloween" Video Mode                                                                                                                                      Page 9


This video mode plays a lot like DDR or Guitar Hero. The screen will show two rows of scrolling flipper buttons on the sides with animation from the movie in the
middle while playing a clip from "This is Halloween". There are several clips which can be selected at random. Each clip has timings in place for the buttons, but the
buttons are different every time you play, thus just because you had to hit three left flippers, one right, then two more lefts one time you see a clip, the next time you
see it you may need to hit two right, then two left, then one right and then both together. Each clip should be around 16 seconds long (covers approximately 40
flipper hits based on how the song goes) and you are awarded points based on your accuracy:


Display Effect   Margin of Error          Award
Perfect!         0~2 ms                   100,000 Points
Excellent        2~6 ms                   75,000 Points
Great            6~12 ms                  50,000 Points
Good             12~20 ms                 25,000 Points
OK               20~30 ms                 10,000 Points
Poor             30~40 ms                 5,000 Points
Bad              40~80 ms                 1,000 Points
Miss             80+ ms                   0 Points


There's also a 2,500,000 point award for making it through the song without failing. You fail the song and end up ejected from the mode prematurely if you miss
three times. You don't actually have to push a button for a miss as it will happen automatically. Once a miss occurs you can't actually get another miss until the next
note comes into the hit range as the flippers will be ignored beforehand.


One potential hurdle for making this video mode is there might be a delay between the audio, video, and feedback from the flippers. This delay will have to be
measured extremely accurately and compensated for to ensure this video mode plays as best as it can.




Status Display Sequence


The following display sequence will come up if you hold either or both flippers up for a moment while there are balls in play and no other major display sequences
are processing:


        "The Nightmare Before Christmas" - "Game Status"
        "Character Modes" - "_ of 7 Completed" - "Complete all to "Deliver the Presents""

Mystery Awards                                                                                                                                                         Page 10


Right next to the Graveyard/Jack shot is the mystery target. Hitting this just once the first time (twice the second time, thrice the third, etc. up to a max of 5) lights
the Graveyard as a mystery award, indicated by flashing the triangle light purple. The visuals for this sequence shows Santa pulling up in his sleigh and reaching
into his giant bag of toys, which then zooms into the screen, fades away, then four different-looking presents drop onto the display. Three of those four presents
then drop away and the one remaining opens, revealing an award.


This sequence is important because there's a secret with this: If both flipper buttons are detected as being held when the presents finish lining up on the display, a
message will appear (along with a seven second countdown) saying to choose a present! The initial present selected is the same one which was going to be
chosen automatically. You can then use the flipper buttons to change your selection and press both at the same time again, or the start button, to select a gift.
Furthermore, the award given is actually determined by the look of the gift, thus clever players can learn what awards come from each and every gift. This trick can
only be done once per game and is also the only way to access Gate Keeper Multiball. It's also a good way to earn rare awards once you know to recognize them.


Despite the name though, the awards are not entirely random. Firstly, several of the awards are marked as (Default), meaning that if no awards are qualified, one of
the defaults is selected entirely at random with equal odds. That said, each award has random odds attached, but this only determines how likely the gift is to be
selected to appear along with the four gifts which show up prior to opening one. This way, certain awards like Extra Ball and Special remain difficult to acquire, even
when you know how to perform the selection trick. You'll never see two of the same gift on the display at the same time, as each gift selected in sequence is
prevented from being selected again for the spread of four gifts being shown. If multiple gifts are qualified, the one selected to appear will be randomly chosen while
the others will be ignored and the other three gifts showing up on the display will be selected as usual.


Add-a-Ball is slightly different. When in any multiball, the mystery target will be solid green. Hit it once to make it start flashing, then again to clear it and light the
graveyard shot with a green triangle. Hitting the graveyard now will start to display the mystery award sequence, but a giant pinball will fall on the bag of toys,
pushing the sleigh and Santa out of the display area and showing "Add-a-Ball" text. Afterwards, the mystery shot no longer functions for the duration of the multiball.
Also, if you start a multiball with the mystery award lit, the graveyard shot immediately lights for an add-a-ball.

Gate Keeper Multiball


This is a super-secret multiball mode which can only be accessed by knowing how to select your gift from the mystery award process. This 2-ball multiball basically
boils down to hitting the gate in front of Oogie Boogie's lair for 250,000 points each hit. The 9 hit lowers the gate and if you get the ball back into Oogie Boogie's lair
                                                                                                     th

you'll get an extra ball, after which the gate comes up and stays up and simply continues to award 250,000 points. The trick is there's no ball save on this multiball,
although you do get one for 15 seconds when the multiball ends, thus you can't double-drain out of it. If multiple targets are hit at once, it still only counts as a single
gate hit, as there's an extremely short delay after any target on the gate is hit where the targets won't register a second time.

Starting Modes                                                                                                                                                      Page 12


The process for starting a mode is different depending on if you're trying to start a Character Mode, Hinterland Door Mode, or an Oogie Boogie Mode.


For Character Modes, each needs to first be qualified, then started. Each character mode has its own qualifying and starting methods. W hen a character mode is
qualified, any shot which will start the mode will flash orange. Only one character's modes can be qualified at a time, thus if you qualify one character's mode then
qualify another's, the one you qualified first will be disqualified and will have be requalified before you can start it. The exception to this is Lock, Shock and Barrel as
they have a special bank of targets and bathtub for locking balls, so they don't override the other characters. (However, you can only have one Character Mode
running at a time, so if you start say, "What's This?" Frenzy, the LSB multiball cannot be started until the frenzy ends. You CAN however combine "What's This?"
Frenzy with a multiball from the Hinterlands or Oogie Boogie.)


Character Mode                     Qualifying Method                                             Starting Method
"What's This?" Frenzy              Spell JACK                                                    Hinterlands (Overrides starting a Door Mode)
"Where's Jack?"                    Spell JACK (Some Character Modes not Complete)                Graveyard, Soup or Mayor
"The Scientific Method"            Spell JACK (All other Character Modes Complete)               Graveyard, Soup or Mayor
"Sally's Stitches"                 Get 100 spins on the spinner                                  Graveyard, Soup or Mayor
"A Marked Improvement"             Shoot Doctor Finklestein                                      Graveyard, Soup or Mayor
"I Can't Make Decisions!"          Shoot the Mayor                                               Mayor (Yes, you shoot once to qualify, again to start)
"Go Fetch!"                        Knock down the Gravestone                                     Zero Kickback
"Kidnap the Sandi-Claws"           Lock, Shock and Barrel Targets                                Bathtub Lock


Character modes are tracked on the display as opposed to on the playfield. Each character mode you complete shows up as a small head symbol of that character
under the scores. Jack gets two heads since you have to complete two different Jack modes (but not all three as you can only play one of "Where's Jack?" and "The
Scientific Method"). Once a mode is complete it cannot be qualified again until you've completed all the other Character modes and play the "Deliver the Presents"
Wizard Mode.


"Kidnap the Sandi-Claws" is an exception to this as it simply gets more difficult to qualify and lock balls with each completion and is meant to be a multiball you can
reliably go for without understanding the rest of the rules. The first time, you only have to complete the LSB standup targets once to enable all three bathtub locks.
The second time and onwards you have to complete the LSB standups three times, once for each ball you wish to lock.


For Hinterland Doors, there's seven lights arranged in a ring near the flippers. Any light which is off is a mode you haven't completed. Any light which is solid is a
mode you have completed. Any light which is flashing is the mode currently selected to start if you shoot into the Hinterlands. The selected Hinterlands Door is
changed by the slingshots, thus you have a little control over this. Completing (not necessarily starting) all the Hinterland Door modes in order awards an extra
25,000,000 Chronological Holidays Jackpot. Once you have completed a particular door mode it cannot be played again until after playing the "Holiday Rescue"
Wizard Mode.

Starting Modes   (Continued)                                                                                                                                    Page 13


For Oogie Boogie, there's a gate in front of his lair which bars access. Getting through the gate is a different process for each Oogie Boogie mode you have yet to
play and involves different colours of bugs. Once the gate is down though, all you have to do is shoot the ball into his lair to start the next Oogie Boogie mode. If you
manage to get a ball back there with the gate up, you can start the next mode without having to knock the gate down. Unlike Character and Door modes, Oogie
Boogie modes MUST be completed in order.


To open the gate for each Oogie Boogie mode (including the wizard mode), first it's important to understand the bug colours:


Bug Colour       How it Works
Yellow          Simply hit it and it clears away
Green           When hit, it turns red and counts as cleared
Red             If you hit a red bug before you finish clearing the rest, ALL bugs reset to how they started!
Purple          When hit the first time, starts flashing. You then have 10 seconds to hit it again to clear it away, otherwise it stops flashing


Oogie Boogie Mode                 Defending Bugs

Brief Description
30 Second timed frenzy mode where almost all switches award points. Hitting any of the JACK targets increases the frenzy value. You must reach a target score to
complete the frenzy and progress towards "Deliver the Presents".


Scenario
Jack's fallen through the Christmas Town door in the Hinterlands and is wondering what everything is.


Details
To help Jack discover the magic of Christmas Town you must shoot everything! The base value for every switch starts at 40,000, but hitting any of the JACK
standups increases this value by 5,000. The mode only lasts 30 seconds and you must score at least 2,000,000 to complete and end the mode.


Scoring
Frenzy Base Value                 40,000
Increments to Base Value          5,000 / each


Lighting
The lighting in this mode is mostly just festive and fun and meant to distract the player. The JACK targets will be flashing yellow and will ALL flash green briefly when
one is hit to indicate the increase in the frenzy value.


Difficulty Adjustments
Very Easy         40 Seconds - Goal of 1,000,000 Points
Easy              35 Seconds - Goal of 1,500,000 Points
Normal            30 Seconds - Goal of 2,000,000 Points

Brief Description
Simple 3-Ball multiball with a jackpot shot which needs to be relit once collected and can be made super by completing other shots first.


Scenario
Nobody in Halloween Town knows where Jack's gone off to, but then, Jack's on his way back anyways so it's not a big deal.


Details
Once started, the ball count is brought up to 3 and three of the major shots will light up, one as a jackpot (always the right ramp), as well as two random shots as
super qualifiers. If you hit the two super qualifiers first, the jackpot shot will become a super jackpot, but you must make it within 7 seconds or else it will time out, go
back to a regular jackpot, and two major shots will relight to qualify for a super. Once a jackpot or super jackpot is made, the major shots will unlight and you must
spell JACK to qualify another jackpot as well as the super modifiers. The mode is completed simply by being started.


Scoring
Jackpot                            5,000,000
Next Jackpot Increase              2,500,000
Super Jackpot                      20,000,000
Next Super Increase                10,000,000


Lighting
The jackpot shot flashes yellow on the triangle only while the super qualifiers flash cyan on their triangles. If you qualify a super, the jackpot will now flash white, both
on the triangle and the circle. W hen the jackpot needs to be re-qualified, the JACK lights will flash yellow and will go solid when one is hit. Once all are solid they will
flash rapidly as the jackpot and super qualifier shots relight.


Difficulty Adjustments
Very Easy         Only one shot to qualify super for 10 seconds, only need to hit one JACK standup to relight jackpots
Easy              Two shots to qualify super for 10 seconds, only need to hit one JACK standup to relight jackpots
Normal            Two shots to qualify super for 7 seconds, need to hit all four JACK standups to relight jackpots
Hard              Three shots to qualify super for 7 seconds, need to hit all four JACK standups to relight jackpots
Very Hard         Three shots to qualify super for 5 seconds, need to hit all four JACK standups to relight jackpots

Brief Description
Special multiball played instead of "W here's Jack?" if all other character modes are completed before trying to start "W here's Jack?" for your first time. The goal is to
make randomly selected major shots, then get the ball into the graveyard for a jackpot.


Scenario
Jack is up in his tower trying to figure out what makes Christmas so special. He needs to experiment with various things to discover the answers he seeks.


Details
When this mode begins, the ball count is brought up to 2, the gravestone is reset, and two major shots (excluding the graveyard) will be selected at random. Add-a-
Ball is disabled for this multiball. When you shoot a lit major shot, it will be cleared. Once all major shots are cleared, the gravestone can be knocked down and
entering the Graveyard will award a jackpot. Attempting to shoot the graveyard without a jackpot lit will reset the gravestone immediately. You can upgrade the
jackpot into a super jackpot by spelling JACK entirely after the jackpot is lit but before collecting it. Once a jackpot is collected, the ball count will increase by 1, a 10
second ball saver will be activated, and the number of major shots you need to clear for the next jackpot to light will also be one higher. You can get the ball count all
the way up to 5, though the number of major shots to clear can go as high as 7. Once no more balls are added no more ball saver time will be awarded. The mode is
completed simply by being started.


Scoring
Lit Major Shot                       200,000
Jackpot                              10,000,000
Next Jackpot Increase                1,000,000
Super Jackpot                        25,000,000
Next Super Increase                  5,000,000


Lighting
The major shots flash yellow triangles. When the jackpot is ready the graveyard shot will flash a yellow triangle and the JACK lights will flash cyan. W hen you hit a
JACK standup the light will go solid. If all JACK lights are completed they will rapidly flash white for a moment and the graveyard shot will flash white on both the
triangle and circle.

Brief Description
Shoot the spinner to get lots of points and to complete the mode before time runs out. Upper right flipper is disabled for the duration.


Scenario
Sally's arm has come off! She must stitch it back on before anyone comes looking for her.


Details
When the mode begins and for the duration of the mode, the upper right flipper is completely disabled and the popup post will be on standby to raise when the ball
enters the loops. You must get 100 spinner spins to complete the mode and have 30 seconds to do so within, which seems very tricky, but you can upgrade the
spinner during this mode by getting the ball into the pop bumpers. 10 pop hits will give one spinner upgrade so that each spin is now worth double. 20 more pop hits
afterwards will triple the spinner. The shot multiplier will also factor in, thus a tripler on the spinner shot combined with a triple upgrade will award 9 spins at a time!


Scoring
Spinner Spin               25,000 (multiplied by upgrades)


Lighting
The pops will all flash orange to indicate that hitting them can get you an upgrade. Once both upgrades are acquired, the pop bumpers stop flashing. The spinner
shot will have a flashing yellow triangle.

Brief Description
5 major shots are lit. Specifically: Left Ramp, Right Ramp, Left Orbit, Right Orbit, and Left Pops Orbit. You must make all 5 shots within the time limit to complete the
mode.


Scenario
Doctor Finklestein is trying to come up with a design for a new assistant, but he needs to find all of his build plans.


Details
When the mode begins, 5 major shots are lit: Left Ramp, Right Ramp, Left Orbit, Right Orbit, and Left Pops Orbit. Each one is worth an increasing number of points.
Clearing all 5 completes the mode. There's a 30 second time limit to complete the mode within.

Brief Description
A travelling shot is scrolling across all the major shots really fast. It's worth a ton of points to hit, but completely comes down to luck because of how fast it moves.
Instead, you can shoot the mayor to temporarily lock the shot in place so that it's not worth quite as much, but can be made at all so the mode can be completed.


Scenario
The mayor of Halloween Town needs help to plan the next Halloween, but Jack's not around to help out and the mayor can't make decisions on his own!


Details
When the mode starts, the Mayor toy flips to show that he's unhappy and one of the major shots will light up... but the shot travels to other major shots extremely
quickly, changing about 10 times a second. This is nearly impossible to time, but the shot CAN be made while it's still travelling and is worth a lot more points if made
this way. However, to complete the mode, you only have to make the travelling shot once, thus the best thing to do is to shoot the mayor. This will flip the mayor
around to his happy side and will stop the lit shot from travelling around. It stays stopped for about 10 seconds and will begin to flash if it's getting ready to start
moving again. Making the shot ends the mode, plain and simple.


Scoring
Major Shot Cleared (Travelling)             10,000,000
Major Shot Cleared (Halted)                 2,500,000


Lighting
When the major shot is travelling it lights both the triangle and circle it's on red. When it's halted, it turns yellow. The Mayor shot shows a flashing blue triangle when
the major shot is travelling and goes out once the major shot is halted.

Brief Description
Random shots will light up one at a time and you have to make them. Very simple mode.


Scenario
Zero wants to play fetch, so Jack takes off one of his bones and tosses it out.


Details
To complete this mode, all you have to do is make three major shots. However, the shots you need to make are random and only one is lit at a time. The same shot
will not light more than once during this mode. Once you've made the three shots, the mode is completed.

Brief Description
Similar multiball to CFTBL. Three random major shots are lit, but only one has Santa Claus in it. Once found, you have to get him back to Jack in the Graveyard for a
jackpot, or you can make the jackpot super by hitting all of the LSB targets after finding Santa but before delivering him! This mode also overrides the normal
functioning of the Hinterlands to give an alternative way of capturing Santa Claus.


Scenario
Lock, Shock and Barrel are out to kidnap Santa Claus!


Details
When this multiball starts, three major shots will be lit at random except for the Graveyard and the left ramp, as these have special usage in this multiball. One of the
major shots will have Santa Claus, the other two will be bogus. Once you've got Santa Claus, the shot at the graveyard lights and you must get past the gravestone
and get to Jack to score the jackpot. (You'll also get an add-a-ball if it's been qualified by the mystery target.) This process doesn't change throughout the multiball,
although there's a couple interesting points of note. Firstly, it's possible to upgrade the jackpot into a super jackpot. To do this, you must hit all three of the LSB
standups after kidnapping Santa Claus but before you deliver him to Jack. Secondly, the normal functioning of the Hinterlands is overridden while this mode is
active. Normally, starting a multiball disables the Hinterlands Doors, but this mode keeps them going. If you shoot into the Hinterlands with the wrong door selected,
you get a small bonus and are treated to Jack saying you kidnapped the wrong one. The slingshots will change the selected door as usual. When Christmas Town is
selected, the left ramp triangle will light up to indicate that shooting the Hinterlands will imm ediately capture Santa Claus, guaranteed, but if you cycle the Hinterlands
off of Christmas Town again, the light will go out. Needless to say, this shot doesn't do anything while Santa Claus is captured. As with all mutliballs, this mode is
completed simply by starting it.


Scoring
Wrong Major Shot                  100,000
Wrong Hinterlands Door            100,000
Santa Claus Kidnapped             250,000

Super Jackpot                     12,500,000
Super Jackpot Increase            2,500,000


Lighting
Major shots to aim for will flash with orange triangles. The one with Santa Claus will actually be VERY slightly more yellow. The Graveyard shot will flash a yellow
triangle once ready for jackpot. The LSB targets will flash red when hit before capturing Santa Claus and will begin flashing white once Santa Claus is captured.
Hitting them at this point makes them go solid white and once a super jackpot is ready, the Graveyard shot will flash both the triangle and circle white. If the correct
Hinterlands Door is selected to kidnap Santa Claus in this alternate manner, the left ramp triangle will flash blue.

Brief Description
You have a health gauge in this mode. Certain shots will be lit to score points, other shots will be lit to decrease health. The more good shots you make, the more
bad shots will light up. You have unlimited balls in this mode, although you lose toys every time a ball drains. The mode ends if you run out of toys or health, draining
all balls, then resuming normal gameplay for the current player.


Scenario
Jack is ready to deliver his toys for Christmas! He has to be careful though because it turns out his ghoulish toys may not be a welcome sight...


Details
This multiball mode always keeps four balls in play at all times. You also get a health gauge which doesn't show any numbers but has five (adjustable) points on it
and your toys count will always be shown. At the start of this mode, three major shots will be lit green. Shooting a green shot does multiple things: It scores the
wizard value of 4,000,000, unlights the shot, lights a different shot green, and also decreases your toys count by 1. You also lose 10% or 10 toys (whichever is
greater) any time a ball drains. Every time you make three green shots one of the shots still unlit will light red. Shooting a red shot will damage the sleigh and
decrease your health. If the sleigh runs out of energy, or if you run out of toys, the flippers will die, the balls will drain, and the wizard mode will end. Each red shot
presently on the field also increases a multiplier for the wizard value up to a potential maximum of 8x. If a red shot is selected to become green after making a green
shot, the green shot you just made will become red in its place. Every 12 major shots, regardless of if they're red or green (just so long as they're lit), will randomly
light one of the major shots as a flashing white super shot, regardless of if that shot is already lit red or green, and it will stay this way for 10 seconds. Hitting a
flashing white super shot will score double the wizard value on top of the wizard multiplier, doesn't decrease your toys count, and also restores one point of health,
returning the shot to its previous state, either unlit, green, or red, which it will also return to if the 10 second counter expires. If you make another 12 lit shots while a
flashing white shot is going, it simply adds 10 seconds to the timer for the flashing white shot already going. Ultimately, if you keep the mode going long enough,
three major shots will be green and the remaining seven will be red. If you get to this state the animation on the display will also change to show things getting more
desperate and a fifth ball will be added to the mix. It's important to note that all methods for increasing your toy count (such as the pop bumpers) will not do so while
this mode is running.


Scoring
Base Wizard Value                  4,000,000
Maximum Wizard Value               64,000,000 (8x W izard Multiplier + Super Shot)
Red Major Shots                    500,000 (ALSO affected by the Wizard Multiplier!)


Lighting
Major shots will show flashing green triangles if they'll score the wizard value and will be solid red (not flashing) if they'll damage the sleigh. The super shot will flash
a white triangle and circle.

Brief Description
You must get a certain number of points off the spinner. To help out, the more lit shots you clear the more valuable the spinner gets.


Scenario
Cupid is out and about in Halloween Town trying to figure out how to make the denizens fall in love. He figures just shoot as many arrows as he can!


Details
The goal of this mode is to score 5,000,000 points off of the spinner alone within 45 seconds. However, the base value of the spinner in this mode is only 10,000,
thus without a shot multiplier this would take 500 spins. However, all of the other major shots and many of the standups (JACK, Doctor, LSB and Mystery) start
flashing pink at a moderate speed. When you hit one of these flashing shots or standups it will unlight and increase the spinner value. The idea is to hit lots of
different things to get the spinner value up, then go for spinner shots to clear the 5,000,000 much more easily! The spinner value will double if all 18 of the pink shots
are cleared!


Scoring
Base Spinner Value                         10,000 / spin
Increase per Shot/Standup Cleared          25,000 / spin
Maximum Potential Spinner Value            920,000 / spin (460,000 x2 for having all 18 pink shots cleared)


Lighting
The spinner will flash yellow on the triangle for most of the mode but will flash a white triangle and circle if all 18 pink shots are cleared. Each shot lit to increase the
spinner value will flash pink.

Brief Description
Shoot to the Hinterlands to collect the Pot o' Gold value and complete the mode, but the value should be built up by the pop bumpers first.


Scenario
A leprechaun has snuck into Halloween Town. More specifically, into a cash vault in Oogie Boogie's Lair. He must collect as much gold for his pot as he can and get
back home before he gets caught!


Details
All you have to do to complete this timed mode is shoot the ball back into the Hinterlands, which will collect the score for this mode. However, when the mode starts,
this shot is only worth 100,000. Each pop bumper hit adds another 100,000 to this value with no cap, thus the idea is to collect as many pop bumper hits as you feel
safe to, then shoot for the Hinterlands. The pop-up post to divert to the pops will fire on orbit shots for the duration of this mode.


Scoring
Base Left Ramp Value              100,000

Brief Description
All the major shots are lit for various values, but the values are assigned at random from a pool of values. Once you know the value of a shot you can continue to
shoot it to score those points over and over. You must uncover at least three different values to complete the mode.


Scenario
The Easter Bunny has hidden a whole bunch of eggs all over Halloween Town. Find them!


Details
All ten major shots will flash solid white when this mode begins. Each major shot will also have a value hidden within it. There are ten values to assign thus they are
shuffled and distributed between all shots. There are 4x "50,000" values, 2x "100,000" values, 2x "250,000" values, 1x "500,000" and 1x "1,000,000". When you
make a shot it will change colour to indicate how good of a shot it is. You can then go for that shot as much as you want within the 30 second time limit. Once you've
unveiled three different shots, the mode is com plete and all other unveiled shots will go out, but until the mode timer expires you can continue to shoot the shots

Brief Description
Four major shots are lit for jackpots. Once scored, a travelling super jackpot can be obtained.


Scenario
Uncle Sam's made it to Halloween Town and scared out of his wits... so he comes up with a great idea to avoid being scared: Celebrate with Fireworks!


Details
This is a 3-ball multiball which starts with four shots lit for jackpots: Left Ramp, Right Ramp, Mayor and Soup. Once all jackpots are collected a travelling super
jackpot appears. Once collected, the original four jackpot shots relight.

Brief Description
You must complete the LSB standup bank as many time as you can without hitting the Doctor Finklestein standup.


Scenario
Lock, Shock and Barrel are out trick-or-treating. Everyone in Halloween Town is a good sport about it, but Doctor Finklestein is in the middle of a critical experiment,
so disturbing him would be a really bad idea...


Details
Unlike all the other single-ball modes in this game, this one is not timed, however, hitting Doctor Finklestein imm ediately ends the mode. The trick is to complete the
LSB standups as many times as you can without hitting Doctor Finklestein. You only have to complete the bank twice to complete the mode, but can then continue
for as many completions as you want as the value increases with each completion.

Brief Description
This mode is like an inverse frenzy: Only one shot scores the frenzy value, but all other switches increases it.


Scenario
A turkey has found its way to the edge of Halloween Town... which prompts everyone to go nuts and start collecting all kinds of food!


Details
While this mode is running, the soup shot will score the frenzy value, which starts at 250,000. Every switch hit increases this value by 25,000. You can collect the
frenzy value as many time as you want within the time limit. The ultimate goal is to score 2,500,000 points in total from the frenzy value.

Brief Description
This multiball mode always has one shot lit for a few points and another lit for a lot of points. When you make either, they both change to different shots.


Scenario
Santa's having a rather hard time figuring out who's been naughty or nice in Halloween Town. You need to help him out!


Details
This is a 2-ball multiball which, unlike most multiballs in the game, is not completed simply by starting it. During this multiball mode, two major shots, selected at
random, will be lit. One will be lit green for nice, the other red for naughty. Shooting the green shot will award lots more points than shooting the red shot. Once you
hit either of them though, BOTH will change to different major shots. You must make three nice shots or three naughty shots to complete the mode, scoring either a
Nice Jackpot or a Naughty Jackpot. The interesting dichotomy of this mode is that the Naughty Jackpot is actually worth more than the Nice Jackpot, but the
naughty shots are worth significantly less than the nice shots. Once either jackpot is awarded both the nice and naughty counters reset, meaning you need three of
either again to score another jackpot. Scoring either jackpot also completes the mode.


Scoring
Nice Shots Base Value               1,000,000
Nice Shots Increment                100,000

Brief Description
Most major shots are lit to rescue holiday figures once shot enough times. When a holiday figure is rescued you have to bring them back to the Hinterlands.


Scenario
So it turns out that opening the doors in the Hinterlands may not've been such a good idea... various holiday figures have ended up lost in various different worlds.
Jack sends everyone out to help traverse the doors, find these important individuals, and bring them back to the Hinterlands in order to return them to their realm.


Details
This is a 4-ball multiball and you must keep all 4 balls going to get the best scores possible. The ball saver is a generous 30 seconds when you start and can be
manually triggered and reset to 30 seconds a total of 3 times over the course of the multiball, each time simply by getting a ball into the Graveyard. When this mode
begins, 7 of the major shots are lit to rescue holiday figures. The colour of the shot corresponds to the colour of the Hinterlands Door, so you know who you're
rescuing. Of the 10 major shots, the ones not lit for rescues are Soup, Left Ramp and Graveyard. As for all the other shots, to make a rescue, you simply need to hit
the same shot three times. When you do this, ALL other rescue shots go dark while the Left Ramp and Soup will both start flashing. At this point, you can upgrade
the jackpot shot into a super jackpot by getting a ball into soup, then shooting the Hinterlands, but this upgrade only lasts 7 seconds, so you need to be quick. Once
you get a ball into the Hinterlands, the holiday figure is rescued, you score a jackpot, and the rem aining rescues relight and reset to requiring 3 shots each. This
means it's far more efficient to go for the same shot three times in a row rather than to scatter shots all across the playfield, since any progress you made on other
rescues is lost once you're ready to rescue someone else. If you get down to a single ball, any remaining ball saver triggers are lost and a 30 second timer will show
up. If you drain the last ball or the timer expires, the flippers die and the wizard mode ends, returning the player to regular play following.


Scoring
Rescue Jackpot                      2,500,000 (Multiplied by number of balls in play)
Rescue Jackpot Increase             1,250,000
Super Jackpot                       3x Jackpot Value


Lighting
Holiday figures to rescue will flash the triangle of their shots with the appropriate Hinterlands door colour. When that holiday figure is rescued, the Hinterlands shot
will flash its triangle the appropriate colour. The Graveyard shot alternates its triangle between orange and white to indicate that it will trigger the ball saver. The soup
shot alternates its triangle between white and the appropriate colour to indicate when it will upgrade the jackpot to a super jackpot. Super jackpots on the Hinterlands
shot will flash both the triangle and circle.

Brief Description
All of the standups light for huge points, but the point value of each decreases each time it's hit.


Scenario
Oogie Boogie's first line of defence is the army of bugs he has as his command! Squash as many as you can!


Details
This is a 2-ball multiball. When the mode begins, the gate rises and stays up for the duration of the multiball. The JACK targets, the LSB targets, the Doctor
Finklestein target, and the Gate targets (11 in total) all light up to indicate bugs to squash. Each target you hit is worth an amount of points, but the am ount of points
you get decreases per target each time it's hit. To get the most points possible before draining out of this multiball you must hit as many different standups as you
can. As with most multiballs in this game, this mode is com pleted simply by starting it.


Scoring
First Hit of a Standup            200,000 (Blue)

Brief Description
You must hide from Oogie Boogie by shooting for any shot which would get the ball off of the playfield. In fact, the instructions on the display simply say, "Get the ball
off the playfield!"


Scenario
Santa has no hope in combat against Oogie Boogie, so he hatches a plan to escape, but Oogie Boogie is effortlessly tracking him in the dark! You must find Santa
someplace to hide!


Details
This mode has a 60 second time limit and NO ball saver. The reason for having no ball saver is because one of the potential hiding places for getting the ball off of
the playfield... is the drain! Thus the first time you drain the ball in this mode actually counts as hiding from Oogie Boogie, but because you can't use the same hiding
space more than once, draining a second time will end the ball as normal. This mode kills the playfield lighting, though things will still flash briefly when you shoot
them so that the player knows the game isn't broken. Other places you can hide the ball include the hinterlands, the graveyard, soup and the mayor. Hide the ball in
three different places to complete the mode... with Santa getting captured. Oh well, can't say he didn't TRY!

Brief Description
Health-bar limited mode where you must make shots to keep the mode going as long as you can... at least until you reach a target score.


Scenario
Sally's trying to rescue Santa a decides to distract Oogie Boogie with one of her detached legs. But, it's only a matter of time before Oogie Boogie figures it out, so
you have to keep him going as long as you can!


Details
The health bar for this mode is actually more like a timer and will last 15 seconds. Three random, major shots will be lit for 250,000 points each and will reset the
health bar to maximum as well. When you make one major shot, all three lit major shots will change. The spinner however will be lit for 50,000 points per spin and
will never be selected as a random major shot, while Soup will award you all the points you've accumulated for the mode again, thus if you've scored 312,510 points
since starting the mode, the soup shot will award this many points. To complete the mode you must accumulate 2,000,000 points while it's running, which will
effectively end the mode as well.


Scoring
Lit Major Shot            250,000

Oogie Boogie Mode #4 - "Luck o' the Dice"                                                                                                                            Page 34


Brief Description
You must get the ball into the pops to change the values of Oogie Boogie's dice rolls. If the cumulative value of all of his dice rolls exceeds 32, the mode ends.


Scenario
Santa and Sally are perilously tied up on an insidious platform Oogie Boogie has. If Oogie Boogie presses the lever of his machine enough times, Santa and Sally
are doomed! Thankfully, he's decided to leave the number of his presses up to random chance...


Details
When this mode begins, a random roll of the dice is shown on-screen (total value of 9 or higher) and after 10 seconds elapse, or you shoot the right ramp, this will be
what Oogie Boogie actually rolls. If you're not satisfied with the value currently shown, you need to get the ball up into the pops. To that end, the popup post will
activate during the course of this mode. Each pop bumper hit will change the highest die to a new random value from 1 to 6 and will delay the timer for a moment
until the pops aren't being hit anymore. Chances are good that you will at least get one die down to 1 with enough pop bumper hits, at which point the highest roll
possible becomes 7. This is good because to complete this mode, you must survive four dice rolls without reaching or exceeding a cumulative value of 32. Once
Oogie Boogie rolls the dice, the new value to come up will always be at least 9. The gate to Oogie Boogie's lair remains down for the duration of this mode and
shooting the lair immediately awards 1,000,000 points, but also re-randomizes both dice without resetting the timer. If you make it past four dice rolls, Jack breaks in
and distracts Oogie Boogie, though you only see Oogie Boogie's reaction on the display so as to instill a sense of wonder as to the next mode. If you fail to survive
four rolls, Santa and Sally fall in and Oogie Boogie proclaims, "Better luck next time!"

Brief Description
Several major shots need to be cleared, but the time limit is too small to work within. You must shoot the spinner to build up more time, then you can focus on the
major shots.


Scenario
Jack and Oogie Boogie are battling it out! Actually, it's more precise to say Oogie Boogie is sending Jack through a gauntlet full of traps and Jack's having to dodge
everything.


Details
This mode only gives you a 15 second time limit to shoot 8 of the major shots. (The only two major shots not lit are the spinner and Graveyard.) This is too small of a
time limit, obviously, so you need to get more time by shooting the spinner. Each spinner spin adds 2 seconds to the timer. Once a major shot is cleared it unlights.
Hit all eight lit major shots and the mode is completed.

Oogie Boogie Mode #6 - "Oogie Boogie's Unravelling" Multiball                                                                                                       Page 36


Brief Description
This is a very unusual 3-ball multiball frenzy where all targets are worth points, but you don't actually get any of the points until you're down to one ball, at which point
you have 15 seconds to get the ball into Oogie Boogie's lair, or the mode is failed and you don't get anything.


Scenario
Jack is ready to unravel Oogie Boogie, but he has to be careful in case Oogie Boogie happens to have an ace up his non-existent sleeves!


Details
This is a 3-ball multiball, but not in a traditional sense. When this mode begins, the whole playfield lights up and every switch is worth 50,000 points, the value of
which can be raised by hitting the gate, which stays up for most of the multiball. However, none of the frenzy points scored while this mode is active will actually be
given to the player, and instead are getting "Banked" according to the display. (Non-frenzy scoring will still be awarded as normal so as to be compatible with any
other modes which happen to be running.) Once two balls have drained and only one ball remains, the gate finally goes down and you have 15 seconds to get the
ball into Oogie Boogie's lair to finish the mode and score your banked points. Failing to do this will end the mode without awarding any of your banked points. (But at
least you'll be able to play the mode again.)


Scoring
Every Switch                        50,000 (Banked)
Frenzy Value Increments             2,500 (5,000 if two targets hit on gate simultaneously, 7,500 if all three)


Lighting
All the lights go crazy during this mode, though the gate lights will rapidly flash white. Once you're down to one ball, ALL of the playfield lights go out, except for the

Oogie Boogie Wizard Mode - "Mega Oogie Showdown"                                                                                                                Page 37


Brief Description
5-ball multiball where Jack and Mega Oogie both have health bars. You must make combos to deplete Mega Oogie's health before he has enough time to pummel
Jack into the ground!


Scenario
Through an unknown power, Oogie Boogie has managed to revive himself, growing to many times his normal size as he prepares to smash Halloween Town to
rubble! Jack must do battle with Mega Oogie and only one of them will come out standing!


Details
This wizard mode has some similarities to the wizard mode on Tales of the Arabian Nights. When the mode begins two health bars will show up on the display. One
for Mega Oogie, the other for Jack. Every 4 to 12 seconds, randomly selected for each attack, Mega Oogie will attack Jack and damage his health. While this mode
is running, all five balls will be in play and if one drains the player immediately gets it back. The idea of this mode is to score combos. Combos are normally disabled
during multiballs because of how high they could get during multiballs. To that end, normal combo awards are not awarded during this wizard mode. The greater the
combo you make, the more damage you do. A 10-hit combo, which is the maximum possible, will hurt Mega Oogie for almost 1/2 of his health, while a 2-hit combo
will hardly scratch him. Jack can survive for approximately 1 1/2 minutes, but random luck could alter this a little. Jack and Mega Oogie both have 120 HP. Each time
Jack is hit he takes 10 HP damage. A single major shot, starting a combo, damages Mega Oogie for 1 HP. When you obtain a 2x combo you do an additional 2HP
damage. Getting up to 3x does an additional 3 HP damage. Thus if you manage to max out at a 10x combo, you will have done a total of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 +
8 + 9 + 10 HP of damage, which is 55 HP in total. Every point of damage you do scores a large number of points and winning the battle scores an additional
100,000,000. The gate also stays closed during this mode and each hit to a standup target on the gate counts as 1 HP of damage to Mega Oogie.


Scoring
Every 1 HP Damage to Mega Oogie                        1,000,000
Win the Battle                                         100,000,000


Lighting
Combo lighting works as expected, except all major shots flash when no combo is ready to indicate that you can start a combo. The lights in front of the gate flash
green and rapidly flash white when hit.

Ultimate Wizard Mode - "Christmas Time in Halloween Town" Multiball Frenzy                                                                                           Page 38


Brief Description
5-ball multiball frenzy where every switch is worth the same number of points, except each time you hit a switch you haven't yet hit since starting the mode, the point
value goes up.


Scenario
Well, you've come to the end of a long journey. As such, it's time to celebrate with Christmas with everyone in Halloween Town!


Details
This is a 5-ball multiball frenzy mode. The base value for all switches starts at 100,000, but increases by 25,000 each time you hit a switch you haven't yet hit during
the mode. This includes switches you normally wouldn't want to hit such as the drain, outlanes, etc. A 2x multiplier is applied to all frenzy scores once you've hit at
least 50% of all switches, a 3x multiplier once you've hit 85% of all switches, a 4x multiplier once you've hit all but two switches, a 5x multiplier for all but one switch,
and a 10x multiplier for managing to hit every switch in the game at least once!


Scoring
Base Frenzy Value                                    100,000
Frenzy Increment for each Unique Switch Hit          25,000


Frenzy Multipliers
Less than 50% of All Switches = 1x
50% of All Switches = 2x
85% of All Switches = 3x
All But 2 Switches = 4x
All But 1 Switch = 5x
All Switches Hit at least Once = 10x


Lighting
The lighting goes nuts in this mode for obvious reasons: It doesn't really matter what you hit! However, the display will actually tell you what percentage of the
switches you've hit at least once until there's only 5 left. At which point, it will count them down individually. The display never actually tells you which switches you
still have left, since part of the challenge of this mode is keeping a mental record of what tricky switches you've gotten, since there's little else to do other than shoot
everything!

Category - Disables
Adj. D00 - "Disable Gate"               Default "No". Set to "Yes - Stuck Up" or "Yes - Stuck Down" when there is a problem with the gate to allow the game to
                                        continue to play. When stuck down, shots to Oogie Boogie's Lair will simply squash the bugs from left to right with each
                                        shot. When stuck up, shots to the gate when the gate should be down will be treated as shots to Oogie Boogie's Lair.

Adj. D03 - "Disable Gravestone"         Default "No". Set to "Yes" if the gravestone drop target isn't resetting or registering.
Adj. D04 - "Disable Spinner"            Default "No". Set to "Yes" if the spinner is having issues so that shots which would pass through the spinner will award
                                        virtual spins.

                               but cannot be played due to league/tournament rules, once the ball is launched out of the shooter lane, the game will count how
                               many times the flippers are energized. Once the indicated limit of flips is reached, the flippers can no longer change state from off to
                               energized until the ball ends. (An energized flipper will stay energized until the player lets go of the flipper button.)
Adj. F09 - "Balls per Game"    Default "3". Set between 1 and 7 for number of balls to give per game.
Adj. F10 - "Balls Remaining"   Default "Off". Turning "On" will show the number of balls remaining instead of the number of balls played.

                               savers for more or less than the default of 15 seconds, in which case they're affected by the percentage indicated instead.
Adj. F13 - "Mystery Awards"    Default "On". Settings of "Off", "On", "Fixed - Tournament", "Fixed - Extra Ball", "Fixed - 1,000,000", "Fixed - 5,000,000", "Fixed -

Adj. F15 - "Multiball Add-a-Ball" Default "Allowed". Settings of "Not Allowed" and "Allowed". Determines if the Add-a-Ball award on the mystery shots is allowed
                                  during most multiballs.
Adj. F16 - "End Game Match"       Can set to "On" or "Off". Determines if a match number will be shown at the end of the game.
Adj. F17 - "Match % Chance"       Can set between "1%" and "20%". Determines how often a match is awarded at the end of a game. One chance is rolled per
                                  different match number at the end, thus if four players have four different match numbers at the end of a game and the chance is
                                  set to 7%, there's 4x 7% chances a match will be selected to occur.
Adj. F18 - "Replay Setting"       Default "Automatic". Settings of "Automatic", "Fixed" and "Disabled". Determines if a replay award is present and if it's based on an
                                  automatically adjusted score, or if it's based on a fixed score.
Adj. F19 - "Replay Score"         Default of "35,000,000". Can be set to any multiple of 5,000,000 up to 995,000,000. This is either the fixed replay value, or the
                                  minimum automatic replay value. In automatic mode, the replay value advances by 50% of its minimum value each time it's
                                  exceeded and drops back to normal at a rate of 10% of its minimum value per game.
Adj. F20 - "Replay Award"         Default of "Special". Can be set to "Special" or "Extra Ball".
Adj. F21 - "Custom Message"       Defaults to disabled, or you can input three lines of a custom message to show during the attract mode.
Adj. F22 - "Attract Sound"        Defaults to "On". Can be set to "On" or "Off". Determines if sound and music can play during attract mode.
Adj. F23 - "Allow Missing Balls" Defaults to "1", can be set to "No", "1" or "2". Allows this many balls to be reported as missing to the system while still allowing the
                                  game to play. Multiballs which would normally go up past 3 or 4 balls when in missing balls mode will simply not go that high. If the
                                  number of balls in the trough ever exceeds how many the game figures are present for a period of at least 2 seconds it will figure
                                  the missing balls have been found/unstuck. Balls won't be assumed missing mid-game until the game attem pts to start a third ball
                                  search. Prior to starting, if any balls are missing the game will always do one ball search, wait a moment, then treat the game as
                                  having as many balls as are in the trough.
Adj. F24 - "Use Knocker"          Default to "For Specials". Can be set to "No", "For Specials", "For Extra Balls & Specials". Determines if and when to use the
                                  knocker.
Adj. F25 - "Set Time & Date"      Can change the current time and date used by the game's internal clock.

NOTE: This section seems like it might be more trouble than it's worth given the massive number of payment variations around the world... at the same time though,
there's something to be said about having a game which is perfectly capable of being set to coin-op... You'd have to do more research on this as what I've included
